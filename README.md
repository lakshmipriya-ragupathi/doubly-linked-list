# doubly-linked-list
## doubly linked list using classes in cpp
<br/>Write a C++ program to implement a doubly linked list with insert, delete, display, and merge operations. The insert operation gets a value and inserts in the correct sorted position (ascending sort). The delete operation takes a position value in which a node can be deleted. The display option will get a list head and print the list. The merge option takes two sorted DLLs and returns a sorted merged DLL in O(m + n) computational time, where m and n are the length of the input DLLs. Print all the 3 lists at the end.

Utilize dynamic memory management wherever necessary.<br/>
<br/>The program has the following menu
<br/>Insert
<br/>Delete
<br/>Display
<br/>Merge
<br/>Exit
